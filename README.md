# @archway/jsh

Instead of using a transpiler like babel to use JSX, why not code HTML using vanilla hyperscript functions?

## Installation
```
npm i @archway/jsh
```
You can use Archway with a module bundler like Webpack to import it into your application. Alternatively, include Archway with a `script` tag with a module type.
