# @archway/jsh

Instead of using a transpiler like babel to use JSX, why not code HTML using vanilla hyperscript functions?

## Installation

```
npm i @archway/jsh
```

You can use Archway with a module bundler like Webpack to import it into your application. Alternatively, include Archway with a `script` tag with a module type.

```html
<script type="module">
  import jsh, { h1 } from "https://unpkg.com/@archway/jsh@latest?module";
</script>
```
